  The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera, native to Africa and India. It has a muscular, broad-chested body; a short, rounded head; round ears; and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane.

      White Lions are not albinos, but a genetic rarity unique to one endemic region on the globe: The UNESCO Kruger-to-Canyons Biosphere region. Currently, lions in South Africa have been classified by CITES (Convention for the International Trade in Endangered Species) and the IUCN as a species of “least concern”.
